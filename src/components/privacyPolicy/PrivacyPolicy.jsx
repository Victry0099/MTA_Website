              Welcome to MTA India's websites. We appreciate your interest in
              us. When you visit and navigate our sites and when you communicate
              with us via our sites, we will not collect personal information
              about you unless you provide us that information voluntarily. Any
              non-public personal information that you may provide via our sites
              will be used solely for the purpose stated on the page where it is
              collected. (In some cases, and in all cases where required by law
              or regulation, you will be able to update the information that you
              provide to us either by sending us an e-mail or, where you have
              established personal profiles with us, by updating your profile
              online. Please refer to the specific pages where data is collected
              for more information.) MTA INDIA will not sell, license, transmit
              or disclose this information outside of MTA INDIA and its
              affiliated companies unless (a) expressly authorized by you, (b)
              necessary to enable MTA INDIA contractors or agents to perform
              certain functions for us, or (c) required or permitted by law. In
              all cases, we will disclose the information consistent with
              applicable laws and regulations and we will require the recipient
              to protect the information and use it only for the purpose it was
              provided.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              By “personal information,” we mean data that is unique to an
              individual, such as a name, address, Social Security number,
              e-mail address, or telephone number. From time to time, we may
              request personal information from you at our sites in order to
              deliver requested materials to you, respond to your questions, or
              deliver a product or service.

              We welcome your comments or questions about our websites and have
              provided e-mail boxes for that purpose. We will share your
              comments and questions with our customer service representatives
              and those employees most capable of addressing your questions and
              concerns.

              Please note that your e-mail, like most, if not all, non-encrypted
              Internet e-mail communications, may be accessed and viewed by
              other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while
              in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please
              do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that you
              consider confidential. If you wish, you may contact us instead via
              non-cellular telephone at the numbers provided at various
              locations on our sites or, in the case of our health plan members,
              at the Member Services toll-free number that appears on your ID
              card.

              There are some locations on MTA INDIA’s websites where we have
              made special provisions for a more secure environment in which we
              can exchange information with you. At each of these locations, we
              will provide you with appropriate instructions.

              From time to time, MTA INDIA websites may provide links to other
              websites, not owned or controlled by MTA INDIA, that we think
              might be useful or of interest to you. We cannot, however, be
              responsible for the privacy practices used by other website owners
              or the content or accuracy of those other websites. Links to
              various non-MTA INDIA websites do not constitute or imply
              endorsement by MTA INDIA of these websites, any products or
              services described on these sites, or of any other material
              contained in them.

              MTA INDIA has adopted and adheres to stringent security standards
              designed to protect non-public personal information at
              www.mtaindia.com against accidental or unauthorized access or
              disclosure. Among the safeguards that MTA INDIA has developed for
              this site are administrative, physical, and technical barriers
              that together form a protective firewall around the information
              stored at this site. We periodically subject our site to simulated
              intrusion tests and have developed comprehensive disaster recovery
              plans.
