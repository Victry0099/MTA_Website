                  courses shall commence on the date specified by MTA in the
                  order confirmation or SOW. MTA reserves the right to change or

                  MTA will use reasonable efforts to give notice of any
                  cancellation of any course. If the course cannot be
                  rescheduled, Customer may be entitled to a refund of any fee
                  paid in respect of the canceled services but shall not
                  otherwise be entitled to any compensation, costs, losses, or
                  damages arising from such cancellation.

                <li>
                  Cancellations or rescheduling of courses must be made within
                  the specified number of MTA business days prior to the start
                  date of the class or the full tuition will be charged. Such
                  days will be specified in the SOW or order confirmation

                  MTA reserves the right to change course prices at any time. In
                  the event of such change, confirmed registrations will be
                  honored at the original price. Registrations confirmed by a
                  purchase order within 30 days of a price increase will also be

                  Prices are exclusive of, and Customer shall pay, all taxes,
                  duties, levies, or fees, or other similar charges imposed on
                  MTA or on Customer by any taxing authority (other than taxes
                  imposed on MTA's income) related to Customer's order unless
                  Customer has provided MTA with an appropriate exemption
                  certificate. Such taxes and duties, when applicable, will be
                  added to MTA's invoices. Further, if class deliveries are
                  requested outside of the original invoicing country, it may be
                  necessary for MTA to issue an invoice from the delivery
                  country location.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Customer agrees to pay, without offset, all invoiced amounts
                  within thirty (30) days of MTA's invoice date. MTA may change
                  credit or payment terms for unfulfilled orders if, in MTA's
                  reasonable opinion, Customer's financial condition, previous
                  payment record, or relationship with MTA merits such change.

                <li>
                  When Customer has otherwise purchased a volume-discounted
                  education package, Customer may utilize such package for
                  fulfillment of payment obligations for orders issued
                  hereunder; provided, however sufficient credits must exist to
                  pay in full for all MTA Solutions Services that will be
                  delivered pursuant to the order. If additional credits are
                  needed, Customer may purchase such credits from MTA or an
                  authorized MTA reseller prior to the commencement of the MTA
                  Solutions Services or provide another valid method of payment
                  for the difference. If Customer provides such other method of
                  payment the volume discount will not apply.
